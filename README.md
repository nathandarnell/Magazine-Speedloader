# Magazine-Speedloader
## Updates
12/1/2020 - Added a STEP file.  Adjusted the directions to reflect that printing vertical seems like the better choice.  Saved the files to Github in case Thingiverse takes them down: https://github.com/nathandarnell/Magazine-Speedloader

9/10/2019 - Made a OpenSCAD version so you can adjust the text to whatever you like.

4/15/2019 - Added Version 1.6.3 with a slightly wider opening and deeper cut on the front.  Replaced "GLOCK 9MM" with just GLOCK since it *should* fit more than just 9mm (untested on other calibers so far though)

## Compatible Magazines
This has been reported to work with:
* Glock 9mm
* Glock .40S&W
* Magpul Glock 9mm
* S&W M&P 9mm
* S&W Shield 9mm
* Sig M11-A1 (Military P229)
* Sig P320 (a little loose)
* Sig P229 (a little loose)

## Background and Design
I really love my Springfield XD 40S&W speedloader that the gun came with.  It feels very ergonomic and lets you load a magazine with one hand easily.  I have tried a few speedloaders already on Thingiverse for my Glock 17 and Sig P229 magazines and haven't found one that works very well.  Most have sharp edges and are made to be "universal" so that means large and sloppy!

Here is my take on the XD design.  I originally made it for a PMAG Glock 17 magazine and also OEM Glock magazines so it fits those with minimal slop, but I also found it fits the Sig P229 magazines as well, just a bit looser.  YMMV.

Original design in Onshape so you may make adjustments if you'd like: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5e103272bc54265516a2153e/w/3a2c6bf3c8ca8d2b877d3220/e/2a61731fb00d323e89e37289

## Printing
I originally designed it to be printed on its side with supports turned on.  My thinking is that the increased strength would be worth the extra time and effort needed to remove support material.  Several people have commented that they have printed it vertically and it is much easier to remove support material and have had no issues with strength.

## Use
I tend to use this with the web between my thumb and forefinger pushing down on the loader while my fingers pull up on the base of the magazine, but you can also pull the speedloader with your fingers and have the base of the magazine in your palm.  Check out the photos and see what works best for you!
